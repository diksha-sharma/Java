Byteland has NN cities (numbered from 11 to NN) and N−1N−1 bidirectional roads. It is guaranteed that there is a route from any city to any other city.

Jeanie is a postal worker who must deliver KK letters to various cities in Byteland. She can start and end her delivery route in any city. Given the destination cities for KK letters and the definition of each road in Byteland, find and print the minimum distance Jeanie must travel to deliver all KK letters.

Note: The letters can be delivered in any order.

Input Format

The first line contains two space-separated integers, NN (the number of cities) and KK (the number of letters), respectively.
The second line contains KK space-separated integers describing the delivery city for each letter.
Each line ii of the N−1N−1 subsequent lines contains 33 space-separated integers describing a road as ui vi diui vi di, where didi is the distance (length) of the bidirectional road between cities uiui and vivi.
