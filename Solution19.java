Byteland has NN cities (numbered from 11 to NN) and N−1N−1 bidirectional roads. A path is comprised of 11 or more connected roads. It is guaranteed that there is a path from any city to any other city.

Steven is a road maintenance worker in Byteland. He is required to maintain exactly MM paths on any given workday. He cannot work on the same road twice in one day (so no 22 paths can contain the same 22 roads). Steven can start his workday in any city and, once he has finished maintaining a path, teleport to his next starting city.

Given MM, help Steven determine how many different possible M−M−path sets will allow him to perform his maintenance duties. Then print the answer modulo 109+7109+7.

Input Format

The first line contains 22 space-separated integers, NN (the number of cities) and MM (the number of roads to maintain).
Each line ii of the N−1N−1 subsequent lines contains 22 space-separated integers, Ai  BiAi  Bi, describing a bidirectional road between cities AiAi and BiBi.

Constraints

1≤N≤1051≤N≤105
1≤M≤51≤M≤5
Ai≠BiAi≠Bi
1≤Ai,Bi≤N1≤Ai,Bi≤N
Output Format

Find the number of different M−M−path sets that will allow Steven to complete MM orders, and print the answer % (109+7)% (109+7).
